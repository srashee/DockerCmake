# Select based Socket Server with Docker

This project is going to be me creating a TCP server that accepts client connections using the select call for synchnorous multiplexing I/O. It's going to reside within a docker container accessing only the loopback address unless specified otherwise. It's eventual goal is to establish a connection with my beaglebone over IP.

This project is to better use/learn CMake / Docker / and create a functional server if I ever need it.
